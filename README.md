# Linux Journal Archives
Build you own Linux Journal archive website

* Download archives (for instance, using this script: https://gist.github.com/jinie/b8b67c80cb4e18477469ea29488cd1ac)
* Store them into a dedicated folder on your webserver
* Download and configure this script
* Run it

It will generate two index.html files: One will countain links to each archive files; the other will redirect users from your archives folder.
